# Working With Pydantic - Built-in Data Process
==========================
#### Normal way to process data (reading json file):
------------------
the normal princiople, it's fine to work with data but kind of limitting yourself
you don't know anything about the structure of data, you can easily validate and santize it or do things

#### Manipulating Data Class with pydatic
---------------------------
--> when loading data, pydantic could help you add the validator functions to make sure the data is clean, or follow the data Filter that you want it

--> You can actually add the validation to the whole data class.
